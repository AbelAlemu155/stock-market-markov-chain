# Stock Market Prediction Using Markov Chains

## Conceptual Overview

### The Problem

Predicting stock market movements is a complex and dynamic task, influenced by numerous factors. While perfect prediction is impossible, statistical models can help uncover patterns in historical data to make informed estimates about future behavior. This project applies **Markov Chains**, a powerful mathematical framework, to model stock price changes based on their likelihood of transitioning between states over time.

### What is a Markov Chain?

A **Markov Chain** is a probabilistic model that describes a sequence of possible events in which the likelihood of each event depends solely on the state achieved in the previous event. In essence, it assumes **"memorylessness"**—the future state depends only on the current state, not the sequence of states that preceded it.

For this project, stock market returns are modeled as states, categorized into quantiles (e.g., "Bearish," "Neutral," "Bullish"). The transitions between these states are captured in a **transition matrix**, which provides the probabilities of moving from one state to another.

### Why Use Markov Chains for Stock Market Analysis?

Stock prices are driven by both randomness and observable patterns. Markov Chains excel at modeling systems where:

1. The process evolves in discrete steps (e.g., daily stock returns).
2. The future behavior depends on the current state (e.g., today’s market sentiment).
3. Probabilities of transitions can be estimated from historical data.

By leveraging Markov Chains, we aim to capture short-term dynamics of stock price movements without overcomplicating the model.

### How the Project Works

1. **Defining States:**
   - Historical stock price returns are calculated (e.g., percentage change from one day to the next).
   - These returns are divided into quantiles to define discrete states, such as:
     - **Bearish:** Returns in the lowest quantile.
     - **Neutral:** Returns in the middle quantile.
     - **Bullish:** Returns in the highest quantile.

2. **Building the Transition Matrix:**
   - Analyze how often the stock transitions between states (e.g., Bearish → Bullish).
   - Construct a matrix where each cell represents the probability of moving from one state to another.

3. **Stationary Distribution:**
   - Compute the **long-term probabilities** of being in each state using the Markov transition matrix.
   - This helps identify the overall market tendency (e.g., predominantly Neutral or Bearish).

4. **Simulating Future Price Paths:**
   - Starting from an initial state, simulate the next steps based on the transition probabilities.
   - Generate multiple scenarios to estimate potential future price distributions.

5. **Backtesting and Evaluation:**
   - Validate the model by comparing its predictions to actual historical prices.
   - Adjust parameters (e.g., number of states) to optimize performance.

### Key Insights from Markov Chains

- **Simplification with Meaning:** By categorizing continuous data (returns) into discrete states, Markov Chains provide a simplified yet powerful way to analyze and predict stock trends.
- **Probabilistic Understanding:** Instead of deterministic predictions, this model offers probabilities of different scenarios, which is more aligned with real-world stock behavior.
- **Visualization and Metrics:** Transition matrices and stationary distributions offer a unique lens for interpreting market patterns.

This approach is not meant to replace sophisticated financial models but serves as a robust starting point for understanding stock market behavior using a structured, probabilistic framework. With further enhancements, such as incorporating external indicators (e.g., volume, macroeconomic data), the model can be extended to provide deeper insights.
